                          Nepenthes truncata (/nɪˈpɛnθiːz trʌŋˈkɑːtə/; from Latin truncatus "terminating abruptly") is a tropical pitcher plant endemic to the Philippines. It is known from the islands of Dinagat, Leyte, and Mindanao.[3] The species grows at an elevation of 0–1500 m above sea level.[4] Nepenthes truncata is characterised by its heart-shaped (truncate) leaves and very large pitchers, which can reach up to 40 cm in height.

                    On September 29, 2006, at the Botanical Gardens in Lyon, France, a Nepenthes truncata was photographed containing the decomposing corpse of a mouse. This incident is the first record of a mammal being successfully trapped in the pitchers of N. truncata indoors. Both N. rajah [7] and N. rafflesiana[8] are known to occasionally catch small mammals in the wild. Although it is possible for Nepenthes truncata to trap mice, the calcium heavy bones will not be digested.[
