                          Rafflesia arnoldii, the corpse flower[2] or giant padma,[3] is a species of flowering plant in the parasitic genus Rafflesia. It is noted for producing the largest individual flower on Earth.[4] It has a strong and unpleasant odor of decaying flesh. It is native to the rainforests of Sumatra and Borneo.[5] Although there are some plants with larger flowering organs like the titan arum (Amorphophallus titanum) and talipot palm (Corypha umbraculifera), those are technically clusters of many flowers.

                          Rafflesia arnoldii is one of the three national flowers in Indonesia, the other two being the white jasmine (Jasminum sambac) and moon orchid (Phalaenopsis amabilis).[6] It was officially recognized as a national "rare flower" (Indonesian: puspa langka) in Presidential Decree No. 4 in 1993.[7]

                    The first European to find Rafflesia was the ill-fated French explorer Louis Auguste Deschamps. He was a member of a French scientific expedition to Asia and the Pacific, detained by the Dutch for three years on Java, where, in 1797, he collected a specimen, which was probably what is now known as R. patma. During the return voyage in 1798, his ship was taken by the British, with whom France was at war, and all his papers and notes were confiscated.[8] Joseph Banks is said to have agitated for the return of the stolen documents, but apparently to no avail:[9] they were lost, turned up for sale around 1860, went to the British Museum of Natural History, where they were promptly lost again.
