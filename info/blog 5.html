                          Cotoneaster frigidus, the tree cotoneaster,[1] is a species of flowering plant in the genus Cotoneaster of the family Rosaceae, native to the Himalayas. It is a deciduous tree or shrub growing to 10 metres (33 ft). White flowers are followed by masses of small, globose, red fruits (pomes) in autumn, persisting into winter if not eaten by birds.[2][3]

                          It is widely grown in parks and gardens in temperate regions. The more compact cultivar 'Cornubia' (syn. C. Ã— watereri 'Cornubia') has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. It grows to 6 metres (20 ft).[4]
                          An easily grown plant, it prefers a good soil but also does well in poor soils[1, 11, 200]. It thrives in lime and is also happy in peaty soils[1]. It succeeds in any soil that is not marshy or waterlogged[11, 200]. Succeeds in dry soils[188]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Succeeds in full sun or semi-shade but does not fruit so freely in a shady position[11, 200]. Plants also succeed in quite deep shade[219]. Tolerates atmospheric pollution[200]. A fast-growing plant[219].
                          Synonyms may arise whenever the same taxon is described and named more than once, independently. They may also arise when existing taxa are changed, as when two taxa are joined to become one, a species is moved to a different genus, a variety is moved to a different species, etc. Synonyms also come about when the codes of nomenclature change, so that older names are no longer acceptable; for example, Erica herbacea L. has been rejected in favour of Erica carnea L. and is thus its synonym.[3]
