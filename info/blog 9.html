                          Drakaea glyptodon, commonly known as king in his carriage[2] is a species of orchid endemic to the southâ€“west of Western Australia. It is pollinated by a single species of male thynnid wasp using sexual deception. The orchid's labellum is similar in shape and scent to a flightless female thynnid wasp. It is the most common drakaea and has the widest distribution.

                    Drakaea glyptodon was first formally described by Robert D. FitzGerald in 1882 in The Gardeners' Chronicle.[2][4] The specific epithet (glyptodon) refers to "an extinct South American animal related to the Armadillo".[5] "The whole lip [labellum] resembles in form (miniature, of course) the enormous extinct tortoise-monster, glyptodon, a creature as large as an ox and covered with tesselated scales.
                    Its flower is also similar to those of other hammer orchids in that the labellum resembles a flightless female thynnid wasp, except that the labellum is shorter and more swollen than those of other drakaeas. The flowers are pollinated by the wasp Zaspilothynnus trilobatus. King in his carriage can be distinguished by lacking a spine on the column. The flowers of Drakaea elastica and Drakaea concolor also lack a spine, but the species can be distinguished by having a glossy, dark green leaf (D. concolor) or having a glossy, light green leaf (D. elastica).
