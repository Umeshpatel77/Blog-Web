                          Dieffenbachia seguine, also known as dumbcane,[1] or tuftroot,[2] is a species of Dieffenbachia native to the tropical Americasâ€”from southern Mexico, through Central America, to northern South America and Brazil.[1] It is also native to several Caribbean islands, including Puerto Rico.[1]
                          The herbaceous perennial grows 3 feet (0.91 m) to 10 feet (3.0 m) in height and 2 feet (0.61 m) to 3 feet (0.91 m) in width.[3] The plant's leaves are large and green, and often with variegated white patterns. Like other Dieffenbachias, the sap is toxic. It has showy white flowers.[3]
